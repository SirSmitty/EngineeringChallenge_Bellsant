<h1>Completed Challenge</h1>
<p>
  Thanks you for the oppurtunity to complete this coding challenge for Bellsant. Before I go into how to run the app locally ill give my initial thoughts o nthe project first. The project as a whole took me about 5 hours to 
  complete. I have a lot of expieriecne in typescript and and web developement. Giving me a firm background in react and well as the ability to manipulate the express backend. However the enviroment of react native is new.
  However, I found it to be extremely similiar to react for mobile development and therefore found it easy to jump into it.

<p>
  For the authentiation, I created a noSQL authentication database in firebase strictly for proof on concept. for a large production server, firestore also a great option, depending on the project might not be the best option.
  Additionally although i did not a sign in page, i did not make a sign up page merely to save time. if youd like to create a new user simply type in the username and password into the 2 inputs and click create user. those perameters
  will be sent to the database. if youd like to simply loging in, ive created a test user:
  username: test@gmail.com
  password: Test123
</p>
<p>
  Another point to make in regards to the completed project. I have kept my debugging, and analytical console logs in order for you to makybe get a glimpse of my though process while coding this project however in a finished deliverable
  I know this to not be suitable. I have also ensured to include comments in the areas where I added code
</p>

<h4>Running the App Locally</h4>
<p>
  I have downloaded new libraries on both the frontend and the backend as well so please run yarn install on <strong>both</strong> the native-app and backend folder.

  Thank you once more for the oppurtunity and hope to hear from you soon!
