<h1>Completed Challenge</h1>
<p>
  Thank you for the opportunity to complete this coding challenge for Bellsant. Before I go into how to run the app locally, I'll share my initial thoughts on the project. The project took me about 5 hours to 
  complete. I have a lot of experience in TypeScript and web development, giving me a strong background in React and the ability to work with the Express backend. Although the environment of React Native was new to me,
  I found it to be extremely similar to React for mobile development and therefore found it easy to adapt to.

  For the authentication, I created a noSQL authentication database in Firebase strictly for proof of concept. For a large production server, Firestore is also a great option, though depending on the project, it might not always be the best choice.
  Additionally, although I did create a sign-in page, I did not make a sign-up page, merely to save time. If you'd like to create a new user, simply type in the username and password into the two inputs and click "Create User". Those parameters
  will be sent to the database. If you'd like to simply log in, I've created a test user:
  <br>
  Username: test@gmail.com<br>
  Password: Test123
</p>
<p>
  Another point to note regarding the completed project: I have kept my debugging and analytical console logs to maybe give you a glimpse into my thought process while coding this project. However, I understand that in a finished deliverable,
  this would not be suitable. I have also ensured to include comments in the areas where I added code.

<h4>Running the App Locally</h4>
<p>
  I have downloaded new libraries on both the frontend and the backend, so please run <strong>yarn install in both the native-app and backend folders </strong>.

  Thank you once more for the opportunity, and I hope to hear from you soon!
